      The format returned to the same as 2022, unlike 2023, with changes in
      group order. Each team will be playing twice against the teams in their
      group, against the team in the same row in the other group, and once
      against the remaining four teams in the other group.After the group stage,
      the top four teams based on aggregate points qualified for the playoffs.
      In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match
      titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled
      "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualified for the
      final match, the losing team has another chance to qualify for the final
      match by competing against the winning team of the Eliminator match (in a
      match titled "Qualifier 2"). The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2
      match will move on to the final match. The team that wins the final match
      will be crowned the Indian Premier League winners.
